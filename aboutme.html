                <p class="about__lead">
                    I’m Jenell a dispatcher, Tech Moms graduate, and bariatric warrior turned Brand & Automation
                    Strategist.
                    Launch by JA started while building my Tech Moms final I realized I love transforming chaos into
                    clarity through clean design and no-code automation.

                    My dispatch background taught me calm under pressure and precision in fast-moving environments. I
                    bring that same clarity to founders who feel stuck in tech.

                    I also bridge wellness and technology through breathwork, bringing regulated energy into
                    high-pressure spaces like tech teams, dispatch, and transformation communities.

                    Guided by Human Design, I align systems to how people naturally work. My goal is simple: builds that
                    look high-end, run smoothly, and feel effortless to maintain.

                    <h3>What did you build — and why?</h3>
                    <p>I built Launch by JA not just a class project, but the start of my real business.
                        It’s a full brand and automation system I designed and coded myself in HTML and CSS.
                        I wanted to prove that I could take tech overwhelm the thing that stops most founders and turn
                        it into clarity, speed, and luxury simplicity.
                        It’s for creatives, founders, and small business owners who have big ideas but no idea how to
                        get them online.

                <article class="qa">
                    <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
                    <p>
                        That I actually understand tech now not by theory, but by building. I learned to break, fix, and
                        improve.
                        I learned how to make websites that look high-end but are built on simple, scalable systems.
                        I also learned that community and mentorship matter just as much as design that asking questions
                        and connecting with others accelerates everything.

                    <h3>What challenges did you overcome?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Balancing dispatch shifts, class deadlines, and building from scratch.
                        There were plenty of “why isn’t this working?” moments, but every one taught me something new.
                        Perfectionism used to slow me down now I focus on progress, not polish.
                        And learning to network and reach out instead of trying to do everything solo pushed me out of
                        my comfort zone in the best way.

                <article class="qa">
                    <h3>What’s next?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I’m scaling Launch by JA offering fast, affordable, and elevated brand + automation builds for
                        founders who are stuck in tech overwhelm.
                        I’m enrolling in more certifications Tech Moms AI or Project Management, Canva Pro, Zapier /
                        Make,
                        and CRM systems to strengthen my skill stack.
                        I’m building my mentor circle and local tech network, focusing on real relationships, not just
                        followers.

                        And I’m expanding Rhythm O₂ now that I have my silent-disco headsets to host breathwork sessions
                        for Tech Moms cohorts, local tech companies, dispatchers, veterans, first responders, gyms, and
                        schools.
                        My goal is to bring calm and clarity into spaces that run on pressure starting with the same
                        community that helped me step into tech.

                        I’m also pursuing sponsorships and collaborations to make those sessions accessible to the
                        groups
                        who need them most.My long-term vision includes acquiring and modernizing a local medical-alert
                        company, rebranding it into Beyond the Button a next-generation system that blends tech, safety,
                        and
                        wellness for seniors, dispatchers, and families.
